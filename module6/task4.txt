Set Up the Project:
Create a new React app.
Install React Bootstrap and import its CSS.
Functional Components:
To-Do Context: Create a TodoContext to manage the shared state of the to-do list.
Input Component: Handle adding a new to-do item.
List Component: Display the list of to-dos and delete functionality.
Persistent Storage:
Use useEffect to:
Load the to-do list from localStorage when the app initializes.
Save the to-do list to localStorage whenever it changes.
React Context:
Create a context provider that encapsulates the app's state and actions.
Consume the context in child components.
(for example: pass add todo , delete todo through context provider and use them)
Bonus Tasks (Optional):
Add a "Clear All" button to remove all to-dos.
Implement a search bar to filter the displayed to-dos.
